### Completed: Build website content writer

Created `src/website/content-writer.ts` with the following functions:

1. **writeHourlyUpdate(day, hour, content, metadata)** - Saves hourly updates to `website/content/hourly/day{DAY}_hour{HOUR}.json` with format:
   - day, hour, timestamp, content, runway_days, urgency, current_strategy, wordCount

2. **writeDailyJournal(day, content, metadata)** - Saves daily journals to `website/content/journals/day{DAY}.json` with format:
   - day, timestamp, content, runway_days, urgency, current_strategy, things_shipped, revenue_total, wordCount

3. **updateLanding(currentDay, daysRemaining, runwayDays, thingsShipped, revenueTotal, currentStrategy)** - Saves landing page data to `website/content/landing.json` with format:
   - currentDay, daysRemaining, runwayDays, thingsShipped, revenueTotal, currentStrategy, lastUpdated

Key features:
- Atomic writes using temp files to prevent data loss
- Auto-creates directories as needed
- Word count calculation for content
- ISO timestamps for all entries
- Full TypeScript types exported

Tests: 43 tests passing across 4 files.
