## Goal Setting Task Implementation

### Completed
- Created src/tasks/goal-setting.ts with:
  - Goal and GoalsStore types/interfaces
  - setDailyGoals() - asks Claude for 2-3 specific, measurable, 24hr achievable goals (runs at 00:15 UTC)
  - setWeeklyGoals() - asks Claude for 1-2 larger objectives (runs Sunday 12:00 UTC)
  - getCurrentGoals() - retrieves stored goals from memory/file
  - resetGoalsCache() - utility for testing
  - Goals persistence to .alien/goals.json with in-memory caching
  - JSON and fallback list parsing for Claude responses

- Created src/tasks/__tests__/goal-setting.test.ts with tests for:
  - getCurrentGoals() behavior
  - GoalsStore and Goal type structure
  - Cache management with resetGoalsCache()

### Tests
- All 38 tests passing (including 6 new goal-setting tests)

### Linting
- Biome check passed with auto-fixes applied
