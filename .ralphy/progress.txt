## Build Metrics Tracker

Created src/survival/metrics.ts with the following features:

### Metrics tracked:
- thingsShipped (count)
- revenueTotal (placeholder, starts at 0)
- currentStrategy (string)
- keyMetrics (object)

### Exported functions:
- getMetrics(): Returns current metrics
- updateMetrics(partial): Updates metrics with partial data
- incrementShipped(): Increments thingsShipped by 1
- setStrategy(name): Sets the current strategy

### Persistence:
- Saves to .alien/metrics.json
- Backs up to Supermemory when API key is available

### Tests:
- Added comprehensive tests in src/survival/__tests__/metrics.test.ts
- All 43 tests pass
